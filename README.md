# Typing Test V1

A simple typing test program I created following a tutorial to give myself an idea of how to build one of these apps for
myself.

# Changes I would implement

- Being able to change the time
- Highlighting right and wrong words
- Better UI
- Change the word generation to be something more coherent and realistic
- Write some tests to ensure that the accuracy and wpm counters are correct
